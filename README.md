Repository for Spring Boot applications

This Repository shall be the starting point of all my future boot applications and is in it's early stages.

As of now there is some issues that need to be ammended for most projects, some are as follows.
Fix mysql ssl issue
Add generic template for nav and HTML site with Thymleaf
Set up connection with DB when logging in with spring security
Add Lombok
Set up simple Entity for eg customer to work off for future projects and add CRUD
...

Additions and fixes will be periodically added to this project while working on othe projects based on this one.
